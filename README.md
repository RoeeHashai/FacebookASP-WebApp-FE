# FacebookASP-WebApp-FE

Welcome to the updated Facebook React WebApp, now with full backend support!

This project has evolved into a comprehensive React-based application for a Facebook-like experience, providing a user-friendly interface that integrates seamlessly with our newly developed backend. This allows for real-time interactions and updates, offering a dynamic social media platform.

We've come a long way from our initial focus on frontend designs. Now, with the inclusion of backend services, we support a wide range of functionalities that enhance the user experience significantly.

## Features
### Complete User Account Management
- **Sign Up & Login**: Easily create an account or log in to access your dashboard.
- **Account Editing**: Update your profile details whenever needed.
- **Account Deletion**: Opt to delete your account if you choose to leave the platform.

### Enhanced Interaction Capabilities
- **Post Creation & Management**: Upload, view, edit, and delete your posts.
- **Comments & Likes**: Engage with friends' posts through comments and likes.
- **Friend Connections**: Support for adding and removing friends, fostering connections within the community.
  
### Dynamic Newsfeed
- **Personalized Content**: The feed now displays 20 posts from friends, 5 from non-friends, and 3 of your own, offering a diverse glimpse into the friends network.

## Simplified Access for First-Time Users
To accommodate users who wish to explore the app without going through the registration process, we offer a preloaded guest user account.

#### Guest Access
- **Skip Registration**: Explore the app with a preloaded guest user account.
  - Email: `guest@gmail.com`
  - Password: `12345678a`

## Installation and Setup
To connect to the application, ensure your local server is running and navigate to `localhost:8080` in your web browser. This will grant you immediate access to the FacebookASP WebApp's functionalities.
